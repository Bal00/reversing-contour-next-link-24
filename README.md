# Reversing the Contour Next Link 2.4
Tear Down of the Contour Next Link 2.4 Blood Glucose Meter.

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/medtronic-flash/Lobby.png)](https://gitter.im/medtronic-flash/Lobby)

The purpose of this repo is to document the steps taken in (attempting) to reverse engineer the over the air communications used on Medtronic 630g/640g pumps by examining the hardware and software on a Contour Next Link 2.4 glucose meter.

Current Project Status
======================
Steps currently taken in the reversing project:
 * Dissasemble CNL24 and identify chipsets onboard
 * Attempted to Dump the Firmware of the Ti cc2430 ZigBee radio
   * Firmware DBGLOCK flag enabled, unable to read firmware

Next Steps:
  * Attempt to read flash memory from cc2430
    * Pending hardware delivery

What We Currently Know
======================
The OTA protocol layer is 802.15.4 spec, and pretty sure its ZigBee. A good portion of the protocol is already discovered by Pazaan on his repo at https://github.com/pazaan/decoding-contour-next-link. The current issue at hand, is that the CNL24's USB layer appears to block writing actions, and only supports reading. So with a CNL24 alone, we can read Medtronic CGM and pump settings over USB, but if we want to loop with the pumps, we have to get direct over the air access.

We need to figure out how the AES key is generated by the firmware to figure out how to connect our own custom radios to the pump.

Reversing
=========

## Attempting to Dump the Firmware

The CC2430 is hooked up in-circuit to a nodeMCU devkit.  The CC2430's p2_1 is tied to the nodeMCU's D2, p2_2 to D1, reset_n to D5, and DVDD to 3v3.

![Debug Setup](https://github.com/applehat/contour-next-link-24-teardown/raw/master/debug_setup.jpg)

This Lua script was then used to determine whether the debug interface worked and whether the DBGLOCK bit was set:

```lua
-- Using GPIO from lua to bitbang
-- Debug data is driven when clock goes low->high
-- Debug data is sampled when clock goes high->low
-- minimum clock cycle is 128ns or 7.8125 MHz
-- Data is transferred MSB first

local pClock = 1 -- Clock pin is tied to D1
local pData = 2 -- Data pin is tied to D2
local pReset = 5 -- Reset pin is tied to D5

gpio.mode(pClock, gpio.OUTPUT)
gpio.mode(pData, gpio.OUTPUT)
gpio.mode(pReset, gpio.OUTPUT)

-- hold reset low and clock out twice
gpio.write(pReset, gpio.LOW)
for i = 1,2 do
  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.HIGH)
  tmr.delay(1)
  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.LOW)
  tmr.delay(1)
end
gpio.write(pReset, gpio.HIGH)

-- write the command byte for READ_STATUS
local cmd = 0x34
for i = 1,8 do
  local b = bit.band(1, bit.rshift(cmd, 8-i))
  local p = gpio.LOW
  if b == 1 then
    p = gpio.HIGH
  end
  gpio.write(pData, p)

  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.HIGH)
  tmr.delay(1)
  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.LOW)
  tmr.delay(1)
end

-- read back the result
local r_in = 0
for i = 1,8 do
  gpio.write(pData, gpio.LOW)
  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.HIGH)
  tmr.delay(1)
  gpio.mode(pData, gpio.INPUT)
  gpio.write(pClock, gpio.LOW)
  p = gpio.read(pData)
  r_in = bit.bor(r_in, bit.lshift(p, 8-i))
  tmr.delay(1)
  gpio.mode(pData, gpio.OUTPUT)
end

print(string.format("read 0x%x", r_in))

-- hold reset back at low since we're done
gpio.write(pReset, gpio.LOW)
```

This read back from the CC2430 `0xb6` (`0b10110110`), meaning DEBUG_LOCKED is 1.  This bit prevents the debug interface from executing all commands except READ_STATUS, GET_CHIP_ID, and CHIP_ERASE.  GET_CHIP_ID returned `0x8504`, indicating die revision E.  Trying other debug commands returned `0x00`.
